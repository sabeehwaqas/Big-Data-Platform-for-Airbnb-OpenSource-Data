-- will use the cassandra as the db as it supports the partitioning  and clsuter 
-- my plan is to use to setup the cassacdra cultoer on my local machine like 3 docker container each with one cassacne with docker compose and bind it into a cluster  , no cloud as its might get expensive. Scale using docker (no terraform needed)
-- i will beusing nifi for data ingestion

PART 1 Q1
____________________________________________
--Application Domain:

-Domain: Hospitality/Marketplace (Airbnb) — Real-world big data scenario.
-Why: High volume of transactional and user-generated data (properties, bookings, reviews).

--Generic Types of Data:
--Structured Data: CSV files (e.g., property listings, bookings) and json files


--Technologies Used for mysimbdp-coredms:

-Database: Cassandra — Highly scalable, optimized for write-heavy workloads.

Scalability: Horizontal scaling for growing data.
Write-Optimized: Handles high write throughput.
Availability: Ensures high availability even with node failures.
Both for structure and unstracuutre data
-Why Cassandra:

--Tenant Data Sources:

-Data Source: CSV files (city/month-wise data) and json
-Ingestion Process: Data uploaded to a landing server for batch processing.
-Data Access: Batch data ingestion via APIs or direct file uploads.

--Big Data Workloads:

-Large-Volume Data: Handling large datasets across multiple cities/months.
-Batch Processing: Monthly data uploads processed in batches.
-Scalability: Designed to scale with increasing tenants and data.

--Justification for the Approach:

-Domain: Ideal for real-world big data challenges (Airbnb data).
-Cassandra: Best choice for scalability and performance with large datasets.
-Landing Server: Simulates real-world batch data ingestion from tenants.
-Big Data Workloads: Handles high-volume data, real-time updates, and batch processing effectively.
